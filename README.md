### Dashboard

## Features 🛠️

- **Next.js Frontend**: Say goodbye to boring interfaces! With Next.js, our frontend is as snazzy and reactive as it gets!
- **Smart Contracts**: We've got Solidity doing the heavy lifting, managed with Truffle to make sure your transactions are as smooth as butter.
- **Local Ethereum Network**: Need a sandbox to play in? Say hello to Ganache, our local Ethereum network where dreams come true (or at least where we test our code)!
- **Decentralized Application (dApp)**: Your security and privacy matter. That's why we've gone decentralized, ensuring your data stays where it belongs – with you!

## Requirements 📋

Before we dive in, make sure you've got these essentials:

- Node.js 🚀
- Truffle 🛠️
